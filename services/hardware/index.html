                <p>3 Infrastructure
A functioning computer cluster is a complicated collection of services and pro-
grams that needs to be properly setup and configured. Clouds are common
today where the user rarely have not need to care about the specifics off hard-
ware or networking, so called managed services. This cluster is on-premise,
meaning that we are responsible for everything ourselves. How can we roughly
divide the different parts of the cluster?</p>
<p>3.1 Hardware
Maybe just say desktop computers instead of HP EliteDesk? 10 HP EliteDesk
800 G3 TWR desktop computers with 32GiB ram, Intel Core i7-7700 CPU @
3.60GHz. Quad core.
The processor was released in 2017 and is part of Intelâ€™s 7th generation of Core
processors.
Each have roughly 8TB of internal disk memory with some variations due to
hardware availability. The Ubuntu Server (22.04.02)? operating system is in-
stalled on a 500GiB SSD. All in all the system has roughly 70TB+ of usable
disk space.
Complementing the setup are two Intel NUC8i5BEK mini PCs with 32Gib ram,
Intel Core i5-8258U CPU @ 2.30GHz quadcore, with a 500GiB SSD disk. Re-
leased in 2018.</p>
<p>3.2 Provisioning: Ansible
Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for managing and configuring
systems. Our use case lies in provisioning and configuration management. By
distributing the correct networking information and credentials, mounting cifs
shares, installing software: java, spark, hadoop, while sending out configuration
files to each node and allocating available disk space to the distributed file
system.
This is done by writing an Ansible playbook which contains a series of tasks
you wish for the nodes to complete.</p>
<p>3.3 Compute: Spark (with YARN)
Apache Spark is an open-source distributed computing engine for processing
large distributed datasets. It support multiple high-level APIs for languages
such as Scala, Python, Java, and R. It also works with regular SQL queries.
Configuration.</p>
<p>3.4 Store: hdfs (with delta)
Hadoop Distributed File System works by dividing data into blocks that are
replicated across a cluster, ensuring high-availability and fault tolerance</p>
<p>3 Mobile network data
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobility management
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location area identity
3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Core Net-
work and Terminals; Numbering, addressing and identification (Release 9)
The data consist of mobile network data where each entry represents a con-
nection between a cellular device and some kind of an antenna. The schema is
pretty complicated but to highlight the columns of interest:
Timestamp: The time when the data was collected. The discretization is down
to a couple of minutes.
IMSI: International Mobile Subscriber Identity, a unique identifier for the cel-
lular device stored on the SIM card. In practice this number is transmitted as
rarely as possible and instead a random temporary number is assigned. (source?)
MCC: Mobile country code. A three digit code which shows from which country
the operator of the subscriber is based. Hence if you are subscribed to an Italian
mobile operator your MCC is 222 and will be logged as such even if you travel
abroads. (source?)
LAC:
3.1 What: example, how much
3.2 Schema: IMSI, LAC, SAC, TAC, E-NODE, SECTOR
3.3 Some stats: counts, log-times, proportions</p>
